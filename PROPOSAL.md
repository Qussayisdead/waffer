# Project Proposal (2‑Week Delivery)

## Scope (Included)
- Backend API (auth, stores, customers, cards, invoices, reports, monthly statement)
- Admin dashboard (CRUD, cards, users, reports, PDF/print statement)
- Store UI (login, scan/upload QR, invoice creation, receipts)
- Arabic-first UI + i18n-ready structure
- Basic QA and handoff documentation

## Timeline (2 Weeks)
### Week 1
- Day 1–2: Setup + database + auth + core models
- Day 3–4: Admin CRUD + cards + QR print/export
- Day 5: Reports + monthly statement

### Week 2
- Day 6–7: Store UI scan/upload + invoice flow
- Day 8: Polish UI/UX + bug fixes
- Day 9: Testing + data validation
- Day 10: Handoff + deployment guidance

## Deliverables
- Working backend + admin + store UI
- Documentation (setup, API endpoints)
- Basic training handoff (how to use admin/store UI)

## Why the cost is in this range
- Three applications (backend, admin dashboard, store terminal)
- Role-based auth and security handling
- Database design + migrations + reporting queries
- QR scan + upload fallback + QR generation/print/export
- Monthly statements with PDF/print
- Arabic-first UX (RTL) + i18n-ready structure
- Testing, fixes, and handoff
- 2-week delivery timeline adds urgency

## Assumptions
- Customer provides hosting environment
- PostgreSQL available
- QR printer/card layout requirements are provided

## Payment (Example)
- 40% upfront
- 40% at Week 1 review
- 20% at final delivery

If you want, I can tailor this proposal with exact pricing and client info.
